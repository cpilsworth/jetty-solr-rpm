RPM build for Solr using builtin Jetty

solr version 4.5.1
jetty version 8.1.10.v20130312
log4j extras version 1.1


goal is a serviceable base rpm for deployment of solr on jetty

Usage:
======

0. git clone git@github.com:boogieshafer/jetty-solr-rpm.git

1. edit configurable settings in jetty-solr.spec as necessary
 
2. run the build-jetty-solr.sh script to create the RPM. it should download what it needs and kickoff the rpmbuild process.

3. jetty-solr rpm will be in RPMS/noarch directory

4. after installation edit /etc/default/jetty-solr

5. use the jetty-solr init script to control the service



Package Notes: 
==============

RPM install will create a solr user and group to run the service

JVM options are easily configured in /etc/default/jetty-solr
  -you will probably want to configure Xms and Xmx for your hardware

Logging is now handled by log4j framework
  I prefer logback, and this script used to bundle it, but the admin UI in SOLR doesnt yet work correctly with logback
  -logging for jetty, solr, and the local zookeeper services is using similar configuration settings (rotation, formatting, etc)
  -RFC3339 datetime format + local TZ label for service log events
  -combined format for jetty HTTP request logs
  -log4j extras library is installed to handle log rotation with compression
  -the SOLR admin UI seems to require SOLR related events sent to root logger
  -GC logging is enabled by default, not handled by log4j, it is rotated by JVM
  -the jetty start log is not handled by log4j, not rotated

JMX interface is enabled in a firewall friendly manner on TCP port 1099 with simple authentication
  -read access credentials: monitorRole/mrpasswd
  -read/write access credentials: controlRole/crpasswd
  -reference: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/Tutorial/JMX

there is a very basic script to send emails on java Errors or Out Of Memory to a configurable address
